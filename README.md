# NotFunnyCaptions

generates this meme format that is a gif and has
white bar on top and black text because i didn't find any solution
on the internet for pc

## Usage

`nfc.exe --input input_file.gif --output output_file.gif --caption "caption text\nnextline"`

or just type `nfc.exe --help` ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

## Remarks

~~this took me like 3 hours while sleep deprived
why nobody done this before ;_;~~
